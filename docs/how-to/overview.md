# Overview

How-To Guides are goal oriented step-by-step instructions for specific problems.

They are wholly goal-oriented.

How-to guides are wholly distinct from tutorials and must not be confused with them:

A tutorial is what you decide a beginner needs to know.
A how-to guide is an answer to a question that only a user with some experience could even formulate.
In a how-to guide, you can assume some knowledge and understanding. You can assume that the user already knows how to do basic things and use basic tools.
